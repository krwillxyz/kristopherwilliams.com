## Past
My career has always been about problem-solving and creativity. From software engineering to independent projects, I’ve built a foundation of resilience and adaptability. When change came, I didn’t stand still—I founded Drifting Forms Studio within weeks, turning uncertainty into momentum.

## Present
I work from a dedicated studio in Mukilteo, WA, where my practice blends ink, paint, mixed media, and the occasional machine-drawn piece. The studio is as much a laboratory as it is a workspace, where finished pieces and field studies emerge side by side. Parenting my young son is central to my life, and I balance that role with the discipline of building and sustaining a creative practice.

## Future
I see my work as a bridge between traditional craft and modern tools. Technology and AI are not replacements, but instruments—folded carefully into my process to expand possibility while keeping the work distinctly human. Whether Drifting Forms grows as a studio or opens pathways into new creative roles, the future I’m building toward is one where resilience, experimentation, and thoughtful use of technology drive meaningful work.
