    <p>My path hasn’t been linear — it’s been built from exploring, testing, and reshaping ideas. From software to studio work, each step sharpened how I see systems, patterns, and creativity.</p>
    <p>Drifting Forms Studio grew from that mix: a way to carry curiosity into tangible form.</p>

    <p>Today, I’m an artist working out of a hidden studio in Mukilteo, WA. Ink, paint, mixed media, and machine-drawn patterns all find their place here.</p>
    <p>I balance raising my son with building a body of work — originals, prints, and field studies — each piece part of a larger practice of making creativity sustainable.</p>

    <header>Future</header>
    <p>The future is still unfolding. I want my studio to thrive, but I also see art as a bridge: between intuition and technology, between personal craft and shared experience.</p>
    <p>Whether through this shop, collaborations, or creative roles, I’m exploring how to make the next chapter as intentional as the work itself.</p>
